# MushroomClassification
This is another practice code script for mushroom classification data. Mushroom data contains many features and edibility is determined based on the features.

## Data
This data file is downloaded from machine learning course that I took "[Applied Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-machine-learning/home/welcome)". mushrooms.csv file contains 22 features (columns) and label column.

## Algorithms

### LASSO regression
It is not clear that all features listed are equally crucial for the classification. Correlated features could be removed by applying the penalty term in the cost function. In this project, I will attempt to apply L1 penalty term in the optimization process of regression analysis.
